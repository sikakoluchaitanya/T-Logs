#### i will writing all the react learnings i will gain throughout this project 

### Hooks 
In React, hooks are a powerful feature that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. When it comes to React Context, hooks make it easier and more intuitive to consume context values in functional components. Here are a few reasons why we use hooks in the context of React Context:

1. **Simplified Syntax**: Using the `useContext` hook allows you to directly access context values without needing to wrap components in a `Context.Consumer`. This leads to cleaner and more readable code.

   ```javascript
   const value = useContext(MyContext);
   ```

2. **Functional Components**: Hooks enable you to use state and lifecycle features in functional components. Since functional components are generally preferred for their simplicity and ease of testing, using hooks helps maintain that simplicity while leveraging context.

3. **Reactivity**: When a context value changes, components that consume that context via the `useContext` hook automatically re-render. This makes it easy to respond to changes without additional boilerplate.

4. **Encapsulation**: You can create custom hooks that encapsulate complex logic involving context. This promotes code reuse and separation of concerns.

5. **No Nested Consumers**: With `useContext`, you avoid deeply nested `Context.Consumer` components, making your component tree flatter and easier to follow.

Here's a quick example:

```javascript
const MyContext = React.createContext();

const MyProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState("Hello, World!");
  
  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={{ state, setState }}>
      {children}
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
};

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { state, setState } = useContext(MyContext);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{state}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setState("New Value!")}>Change Value</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, `MyComponent` directly accesses context values using the `useContext` hook, making it concise and easy to manage.


#### why we use both usecontext and provider at the same time 

Great question! The `useContext` hook and the `Provider` component work together to facilitate context usage in React. Here's the relationship between the two:

1. **Provider**: The `Provider` component is used to **define** the context value that will be shared across components. It makes that value available to any descendant components that consume the context.

2. **useContext**: The `useContext` hook is used to **access** the context value that has been defined by a `Provider`. It allows a component to read the current value of the context without needing to explicitly pass it down through props.

### Why Both Are Necessary

- **Creating Context Value**: The `Provider` specifies what data or functions are available. Without the `Provider`, there is no context value to access. It essentially establishes the context's value in a specific part of your component tree.

- **Accessing Context Value**: The `useContext` hook allows components to subscribe to the context and get the current value. This is how components can reactively access the shared state or functions provided by the `Provider`.

### Example Breakdown

Using the earlier example:

```javascript
const MyContext = React.createContext();

const MyProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("Initial Value");

  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={{ value, setValue }}>
      {children}
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
};

const ConsumerComponent = () => {
  const { value, setValue } = useContext(MyContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{value}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setValue("Updated Value")}>Update Value</button>
    </div>
  );
};

// Usage
const App = () => (
  <MyProvider>
    <ConsumerComponent />
  </MyProvider>
);
```

### Key Points:

- **`MyProvider`** creates a context value (`{ value, setValue }`) and makes it available to its children through the `Provider`.
- **`ConsumerComponent`** uses `useContext(MyContext)` to access that context value, enabling it to display the value and update it.

In summary, you need the `Provider` to set the context value, and you use `useContext` to access that value within components. They serve complementary roles in managing and consuming context in React.
