-> Average of 10 searches 
if we are using Sqlite it is 33% slower than redis 
and postgres is 20% slower then redis
and sqlite is again 16% slower than postgres 

conventional Architecture for deployment

Performance Api
![[Pasted image 20241004101636.png]]
in this architecture we have multiple replicas of the database so that it reduces the latency and reduce the search time 
CF are cloudflare workers 

#### Honojs 

using for routing in this projects as it is better than next router methods

``` ts
const app = new Hono().basePath('/api')
// this is the base path so we need to call only path ahead of /api 
```

// basic setup for hono
``` ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { handle } from "hono/vercel";  

export const runtime = "edge"; // this will compatible with vercel as well as cloudflare workers as vercel use edge runtime by default and cloudflare don't

const app = new Hono().basePath("/api"); // this is the basepath so we do not have to make the request from the root path always

app.get("/search", async (c) => {
    return c.json({})
})

export const GET = handle(app) // this is the export for vercel if we want to deploy the app to vercel

export default app as never // this is the export for cloudflare if we want to deploy the app to cloudflare
// never is for typescript compiler
```

#### Way of storing data in redis to get faster search
![[Pasted image 20241004223234.png]]
``` ts 
countryList.forEach((country) => {
  const term = country.toUpperCase();
  const terms: { score: 0; member: string }[] = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < term.length; i++) {
    terms.push({ score: 0, member: term.substring(0, i) });
  }
  terms.push({ score: 0, member: term + "*" });

  const populateDb = async () => {
    await redis.zadd("terms", ...terms);
  };
  populateDb();
});

```
