-> I have choose convex as the whole baas as the database and also for backend

#### Auth using convex and clerk 

-> first have to start the project setting up the convex which is available at convex/ nextjs docs 
```
npm install convex
```
the above line will create a folder for covex which will have your backend and database code and then 
```
npx convex dev
```
which will run the code as a different server 
and then just follow the way convex has mentioned in there docs as they provide there own library with clerk 
https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk

we just have to generate a jwt template from the clerk website and then setup a auth.config.js file in the convex folder and replace the provided the url in the jwt token with the auth.js file and after that just create a provider for the auth 

and also we have to make middleware file to protect the public access to the project 

``` ts  middleware.ts
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/sign-in(.*)', '/sign-up(.*)'];
  
export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, request) => {
  if (!isPublicRoute(request)) {
    await auth.protect()
  }
})
export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
    // Always run for API routes
    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
  ],
}
```

the file step to setup convex-clerk auth is to create a provider file for that 
just create a provider folder in the root of the project and then create a file with the provider 
( providers/convex-clerk-provider.tsx )
``` ts 
"use client";
import { ClerkProvider, useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { ConvexProviderWithClerk } from "convex/react-clerk";
import { AuthLoading, Authenticated, ConvexReactClient } from "convex/react";

interface ConvexClientProviderProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

const convexUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL!;

const convex = new ConvexReactClient(convexUrl);

export const ConvexClientProvider = ({
  children,
}: ConvexClientProviderProps) => {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider>
      <ConvexProviderWithClerk useAuth={useAuth} client={convex}>
        {children}
      </ConvexProviderWithClerk>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
};

``` 

``` ts
                <Footer

                    isFavorite={isFavorite}

                    title={title}

                    authorLabel={authorLabel}

                    createdAtLabel={createdAtLabel}

                    // onClick={{} => {}}

                    disabled={false}

                />

```
