-> Authentication vs Authorization 
authentication is to verify the user and check whether the user is same or not but authorization is for defining the user access roles 
-> jwt token are short lived that is it has the short expire time after which it is useless 

it has two tokens access tokens and refresh tokens 
access tokens are used to get the access of the defined role but as we know that access tokens are short lived so it expires after certain window of time and to get the new token we need to use refresh token and it is stored in the db

this is called as stateless because of no db calls for verification after getting token 

workflow of Sessions

this is called as stateful because for the call to the db for verification of session id
