-> in most of the projects multer is used as a utility or which also act as a middleware 

``` js 
const multer = require('multer');
const path = require('path');
const crypto = reqire('crypto');

//diskstorage // file are uploades to u r local stroage server 
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, 'public/images/upload') // this is the path to the folder where the files are being uploaded
  },
  filename: function (req, file, cb) {
    crypto.randomBytes(12, function (err, name){
	    const fn = name.tostring("hex")+path.extname(file.originalname); // here path is used to get the extension of the file or file type from the og name 
	    cb(null, fn);
    })
  }
})

// export upload variable
const upload = multer({ storage: storage })
module.exports = upload;
```


``` html
<form autocomplete="off" action="/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
	<imput type="file" name="image">
	<imput class="px-5 py-5 rounded-md  bg-blue-500" type="submit" value="upload File">
	<imput>
</form>
```

``` js 

app.post("/upload", isLoggedIn, upload.single("image"), (req, res) => {
	let user = await userModel.findOne({email: req.user.email});
	user.profilepic = req.file.filename;
	await user.save()
	res.redirect("/profile")
})
```

there is a memory storage method which is used to store the upload data directly to the database and not any server which is not the usual method to do
